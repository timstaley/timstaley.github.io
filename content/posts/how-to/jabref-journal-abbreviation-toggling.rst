Managing journal abbreviations with Jabref

If you're writing any kind of scientific paper in LaTeX, 
it will save you time in the long run if you use a reference manager. 
My tool of choice is `Jabref`_. 

Many journals require you to submit references with abbreviated journal names, 
the style of which may vary from journal to journal.

Fortunately, Jabref provides an easy means of toggling your Bibtex catalogue 
journal entries between full and abbreviated form - simply navigate to 
``Tools`` -> ``Abbreviate journal names``.

It's also possible to use your own custom list of journal abbreviations 
(``Options`` -> ``Manage journal abbreviations``). 
Since I couldn't find any ready made lists of abbreviations for astronomers, 
I created a repository at 
http://github.com/timstaley/jabref-astro-abbreviations. 

It's pretty minimal at present - I've only provided an incomplete list of 
abbreviations in the MNRAS style. 
But I thought I'd raise a flagpole, in case anyone else finds themselves 
wanting this functionality. It's a start. `Fork me`_!
