Not much to report here directly of late - but things have been happening
elsewhere. I recently uploaded most of my `presentation slide decks`_.
If anything catches your eye and you'd like to know more, feel free to
`contact me`_. I've also added some links making it easier to find `my
publications`_.

In a wider context, I'm currently trying to get more astronomers involved with
the VOEvent standard, and I've written up a `post on the 4 Pi Sky website`_
explaining what that is and why you should care.
You should also check out the `rest of the website`_,
which I set up. Thanks to posts from the rest of the group it's
becoming a go-to summary of what we're trying to achieve, which is pretty neat.

News on the TraP release soon, hopefully...
