**Or, everything you wanted to know about setting up Ganglia, but couldn't grok 
from the official documentation - part 2.**

In this post I'll cover:

- What purposes the different `Ganglia`_ utilities serve, and how they fit 
  together.
- How to set up a minimal configuration, from apt-get install through to 
  configuring Apache to serve the web interface.
  
(See `part 1 <{filename}why-ganglia.rst>`_ 
for an explanation of what Ganglia is and why you might want to use it.)
