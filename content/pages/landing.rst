Hello!

I'm an independent software consultant and a recovering academic.
Probably the best label for what I do is
`"research software engineer" <RSE_>`_.
In practice, that means I spend my time working with domain specialists
to figure out how to solve their computational problems.

**I'm available for hire on a freelance basis.**
Please take a look at the `consulting page <consulting_>`_ and get in
touch if you might be interested in working together.

For the past few years I've been working in the `astrophysics group`_
at the University of Oxford.
My work here has been largely focused on time-domain astronomy -
chasing things that go bump in the night sky - as part of the
`4 Pi Sky project`_,
which (broadly) aims to automate both the detection and follow-up observation
of astronomical transients.
You can find more background information on the  `research page <research_>`_.
 
Along the way, I've worked on a number of open-source
software packages.
You can find some highlights and brief descriptions on the `code page <code_>`_.


Occasionally I find myself doing things that I think may be of wider interest,
or simply aren't explained very well anywhere else that I can find,
and then I'll write about it, if I have time - see posts_.
