Hello! 
I'm a post-doc working in the `astrophysics group`_ 
at the University of Oxford.
Since October 2011 I've been working with the 
`4 Pi Sky project`_, 
which (broadly) aims to automate both the detection and follow-up observation
of astronomical transients, motivated in large part by the next generation
of large radio telescopes. There's more on that under `research`_.
 
I consider myself to be a `research software engineer`_, and I'm 
happiest when coding (mostly Python at the minute, but it varies).
However, by necessity I've also picked up a good grounding in software 
deployment and system administration 
(or '`devops`_' if you're playing buzzword bingo).
 
Occasionally I find myself doing things that are mildly novel, or simply aren't
explained very well anywhere else that I can find, and then I'll write about it,
if I have time - hence my `blog`_.
