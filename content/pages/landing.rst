Hello!

I'm a researcher working in the `astrophysics group`_
at the University of Oxford.
Probably the best label for what I do is
`"research software engineer" <RSE_>`_.
In practice, that means I spend my time working within a research group to
figure out how to solve their computational problems.
Most of my recent work has been focused on time-domain astronomy -
chasing things that go bump in the night sky.

**I'm also available for hire as an
independent software consultant**.
Please take a look at the `consulting page <consulting_>`_ and get in
touch if you'd be interested in working together.


Since October 2011 I've been with the
`4 Pi Sky project`_, 
which (broadly) aims to automate both the detection and follow-up observation
of astronomical transients, motivated in large part by the next generation
of large radio telescopes.
You can find more background information on the  `research page <research_>`_.
 
Along the way, I've worked on a number of open-source
software packages.
You can find some highlights and brief descriptions on the `code page <code_>`_.


Occasionally I find myself doing things that I think may be of wider interest,
or simply aren't explained very well anywhere else that I can find,
and then I'll write about it, if I have time - see posts_.
