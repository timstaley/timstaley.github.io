Hello! 
I'm a post-doc working in the `astrophysics group`_ 
at the University of Oxford.
Since October 2011 I've been working with the 
`4 Pi Sky project`_, 
which (broadly) aims to automate both the detection and follow-up observation
of astronomical transients, motivated in large part by the next generation
of large radio telescopes. There's more on that under `research`_.
 
Probably the best label for what I do is
`"research software engineer" <RSE_>`_.
In practice, that means I spend my time working within a research group to
figure out how to solve their computational problems.
The solutions range from bolting together a web framework and some data
visualisations, writing an interface layer to legacy code, creating
convenience routines around a low-level library, right through to putting
together a whole new pipeline, or even devising a novel algorithmic approach
and then implementing accordingly.

By necessity I've also picked up a variety of the day-to-day skills
needed to keep a small linux cluster running,
build dusty and undocumented code-packages,
and interface with arcane pipelines built on Fortran.
You can find some examples
of my work under code_.


Occasionally I find myself doing things that I think may be of wider interest,
or simply aren't explained very well anywhere else that I can find,
and then I'll write about it, if I have time - see posts_.
