*In short:*

I'm available for hire as an independent software consultant.
I primarily work as a back-end Python engineer, covering everything from
systems architecture to continuous cloud-deployment. I enjoy diving into SQL,
and I spent 4 years working in C++ for my PhD project.
I also have some experience in probabilistic modelling and data-visualisation.

Read on for a bit more detail.

Things I can do
---------------------------

First off, by training I'm a mathematician. Day to day this doesn't usually
influence my work much, but the analytical background occasionally comes in
handy. (I once found a SQL bug using Taylor expansion. No, really!)

Since branching into software development, I've picked up a range of skills in
order to get things done, working variously as part of a distributed team of
dedicated software engineers, and as the software-focused researcher embedded in
a more conventional academic group. So I'm well versed in the 'bread and butter'
of modern software development and project management -
automated testing, version control, documentation, continuous deployment and
release management
(full shopping list of technologies, tools and frameworks available on request,
or see the code_ page for open-source examples).

The upshot of all this is that I can discuss a technical problem and put
together a clean, maintainable solution using the appropriate tools.
Previous briefs include:

- We have a custom data-reduction pipeline written in C++. It needs to run an
  order-of-magnitude faster, and we need the following new features to
  handle an entirely new data-model...
- We reduce our data via a manual, interactive process requiring significant
  domain expertise and specialized scientific software. We need a 'good enough'
  version of this process to be automated so we can respond to incoming data in
  timely fashion.
- We need a way to archive, retrieve and search through millions of custom
  data-packets, so that crucial scientific clues don't get lost in the noise.
  It needs to be a web-service too, so we can share it.
- We need a way to easily install and run our code on a 'cloud' server, test new
  versions, and make sure we can update it reliably or spin up a backup machine.

and the classic

- We need a web-page.

(Because it's not always ground-breaking, sometimes it just needs doing.)

I'm located in Oxford, UK. Remote work is no problem, but alternately if
you're in the area and would like to chat
in person, just drop me a quick line via email or twitter - always happy
to hear what other techies in the region are up to!
